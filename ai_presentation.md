1. Main Page
     - Project name
     - Project members
2. Introduction
     
     Solve Path Finding problems. Find the shortest path on a grid from a given square A to destination B using:
     - A* search algorithm
     - Uninformed search algorithms
     
     Make use of Manhattan distance heuristics for the informed search.
     There will be obstacles between A and B, and our implementation would show graphically how the algorithm manage to reach the destination, which in turn would visually demonstrate the actual performance of algorithms in real world problems.
3. Motivation
     - In games we often want to find paths from one location to another. How it works?
4. Problem to be studied
     - Search Algorithm 
     - Visualization
5. Existed solutions and our improvement
     - http://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/
     - We implemented in Java and referenced its user interface
6. Brief demonstrate of our achievement
